# Resource Allocation and Inclusion

I have coded this simple decision tree for a friend's company that specializes in diversity and inclusion for the arts.

## Project scope (Done)

- Decision tree logic using a JS object
- Style buttons dynamically based on text content
- Style disabled buttons to show decision history
- Responsive design
- Make new question scroll into view automatically (Works pretty well on desktop, but not on phones)

## To-Do List

- Fix auto-scroll on phones
- Clean up the JS
- Accessability best practices
